# CloudClear
CloudClear is an app that helps you reclain your iCloud space from large videos. I made this in about a weekend after getting constant notifications about my storage being full. This is my best attempt at a solution that doesn't suck.

With that said, a fair word of warning to anybody looking at the code: this is my first SwiftUI app, and it's a bit of a mess. I'm still working on it, but it's still a work in progress and GPT, while helpful (seriously, Apple's PhotoKit documentation is awful), doesn't make neccisarily clean code.
